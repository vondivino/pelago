        "expectation": "As the Nanyang (Southeast Asia) headquarters of Dr. Sun Yat Sen’s Chinese Revolutionary Alliance or Tong Meng Hui, Singapore assumed a pivotal role in the 1911 Revolution, which eventually overthrew the Qing dynasty and led to the birth of modern-day China.\nDr. Sun had many loyal overseas Chinese supporters such as Teo Eng Hock, Tan Chor Lam, and Lim Nee Soon. They provided invaluable support in the form of fundraising activities and the dissemination of revolutionary principles and ideals. Originally known as Wan Qing Yuan, this villa was bought by Teo Eng Hock in 1905 as a retirement home for his mother. He later offered the house to Dr. Sun for his revolutionary activities. It was in this house that Dr. Sun planned three uprisings before the Wuchang Uprising of 1911.\nToday, the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall is a national monument and heritage institution managed under the National Heritage Board. The refurbished museum traces the revolutionary activities of Dr. Sun in Southeast Asia, the contributions of the Singapore Chinese to the 1911 Revolution, as well as the impact of the revolution on Singapore and the Chinese community in Singapore.",

Intricately woven into the hotel are lush tropical gardens. Occupying more than a quarter of the entire estate, they provide a soothing contrast to the urban hustle and bustle.

Native farmers toil all day under the hot sun throughout the year, harvesting only the best of the crop by hand. Today, the SunnyHills tea house, a hidden gem along Seah Street, brings you the taste of these pineapples, responsibly sourced from the Bagua Mountain native farmers and presented in the best possible manner.

Was it for taste? Or preservation? Find the answers to these questions and more by sampling otak otak (grilled fish cake), lotus leaf rice, dumplings, and Nyonya kueh (bite-sized snack). Understand the different types of wraps and celebrate the age-old, sustainable food wrapping culture of Singapore.",
        "expectation": "Wrapping food is an age-old practise in Asia. Our predecessors used the leaves from the hardy banana tree to wrap their food before the widespread use of plastic. Of course, wrapped food is not as ubiquitous as it once was, thanks to urbanisation and modernisation. But using leaves to prepare some dishes is still commonplace in Singapore, from wrapping otak otak (grilled fish cake) to bak chang (glutinous rice dumplings). Through this culinary tour, explore the heritage neighbourhood of Tiong Bahru. Taste the history and culture of different wrapped foods. Discover why people used specific leaves or plants to fold certain types of food. During the tour, you'll also learn the fragrances and flavours of leaves. And you'll get to celebrate a sustainable and environmentally-friendly practise that is a vital part of Singapore's culture.",

Here is where you will discover temples hidden in plain sight. You can even visit the house of a triad boss. Or touch an original coolie coin. One takeaway here is how the old gig economy is not too different from the one we have today.",
        "expectation": "Way before Singapore was a first-world nation, towkays and coolies played vital roles in the city-state's free port operations. Through this walking tour that will take you along the quays and marketplaces of Singapore, explore the divide between the agent recruiters and their indentured 'Piglets' - a derogatory term for the coolies who lived in squalid conditions with poor sanitation. Learn the role of money-lenders, subsidised gambling trains, and how the coolie-coin system effectively removed real cash rewards from these hard labourers. This tour will also upend many stereotypical assumptions of how towkays and coolies worked in the past. Plus, you'll get to visit the former house of a triad boss, touch an original coolie coin, visit hidden temples, and gain an understanding of how the gig economy in the past has parallels to today's 21st-century version.",

The Beyond Expedition team may offer mini-challenges such as seeing who can get through the tunnels most quickly. As the tunnels are pitch-black, you will use a professional Nitecore headlamp for your challenge. These are, of course, optional. And only for those who want a bit more excitement! After the activity, relax and enjoy a relaxing tea session of cookies and freshly brewed masala chai out in nature. Throughout the 5 hours, the Beyond Expedition team will act as your photographers so that you have keepsakes of the trip. Expect to see a side of Singapore you have never seen before. This experience is suitable for all ages, from as young as 5 to as old as 65. As long as you are up for some unconventional fun and are not afraid of getting dirty, this trip is one to try out. This activity happens rain or shine, so bring along a poncho in case of wet weather. Your meet-up is 15 mins before the selected timeslot.\n\nAbout the Founder\nScott Tay, the founder of Beyond Expeditions, started backpacking at 17. During those years and into adulthood, Scott developed into a seasoned traveller. Whenever Scott steps out into the world for travel, he makes it a point to go off the beaten path. \"Unconventional destinations\" - that's his mantra. He is a celebrated photographer with a diverse portfolio ranging from landscape to portraiture. His outgoing and friendly demeanour makes him a charismatic and effable facilitator for your expedition. Plus, his sense of humour and love for the locals and nomads is contagious to those around him.

With this kampong experience, re-live the good old days of village living, discover the simple pleasures of life, and revel in nostalgia. You'll learn how people moved from a kampong to a modern house and the sacrifices made in the process.",

If you didn’t live in one yourself, it would be tough to immerse yourself in their tales. Memories would sound like fiction. And everything would be a faint, hazy picture – a purely hypothetical construct conjured by the mind. But that’s all set to change with this activity. Get ready for nostalgic memories to turn into a reality with this unique kampong experience. Believe it or not, Singapore has one last remaining kampong around, and this is your chance to explore it. With this tour, re-live the good old days of village living and learn how people moved from kampongs to the high-rise flats that most Singaporeans call home. After that, enter an actual kampong house in the village. And take a trip back in time to when things were simpler, when life moved at a slower pace, and when the simple things in life were what mattered.",

The authorities allocated the Chinese the area south of the Singapore River on Raffles’ Town Plan, where they built shophouses and godowns at what is now Chinatown. During this tour, explore three of Chinatown’s four districts, including the landing site of the first immigrants, who showed their gratitude for safely arriving in the country by building Singapore’s oldest Chinese Temple. As for Kampong Glam, it was a Malay enclave divided into three sections in Raffles’ Town Plan - one for the Sultan, one for the Arab traders, and one for the Bugis settlers. Today, Kampong Glam retains much of its traditional characteristics. But, the area has also grown to become one of Singapore’s most bohemian and hippest hoods, bursting at the seams with cafés, bars, and clubs sitting alongside the golden Sultan mosque and adjacent heritage centre.",

During this tour, explore the area's old-world charm, heritage, and range of trendy offerings.",
        "expectation": "Upon stepping into Tiong Bahru, you will immediately notice an intriguing mix of the old and new. The transformation from swamp to swank began in the '30s, and some of the landmarks from that era still stand today, including the unique residential blocks and the first Monkey God Temple dedicated to the main character from the Chinese literary classic, Journey to the West. This walk will take you around one of the oldest public residential estates in Singapore to explore pre-war and post-war architecture. You will also learn about the history and heritage associated with this charming neighbourhood, with its rows of quaint Art Deco buildings.

        "expectation": "Get ready for an adventure as this tour takes you to two very different old quarters of Singapore - Little India and Kampong Glam. These two neighbourhoods were conceived in Sir Stamford Raffles’ 1822 Master Town Plan to help immigrants from different communities settle and thrive in a new land. During this tour, Little India will mesmerise you with its vibrant colours, silks, gold, the wafting smells from incense and curries, and the hypnotic clangs of temple bells. You’ll discover that Little India was the second place Indian immigrants settled after abandoning their first allotment next to Chinatown. As for Kampong Glam, it was a Malay enclave divided into three sections in Raffles’ Town Plan - one for the Sultan, one for the Arab traders, and one for the Bugis settlers. Today, Kampong Glam retains much of its traditional characteristics. But, the area has also grown to become one of Singapore’s most bohemian and hippest hoods, bursting at the seams with cafés, bars, and clubs sitting alongside the golden Sultan mosque and adjacent heritage centre.",
